# Echo-Server-on-Docker
Docker based Echo VR Server with Error-Checking and restarts if an error occours.
It also can autoupdate the Echo Binarys to the newest EchoTools Version, so that the server is always up to date. (You can always deactivate that) 

With this Repo you can automatically install and configure everything  you need to run the Echo Server Instances in Docker Containers.

As the Dockerfile is based on the ARM Version of Unusual Norm, a special thanks to him!

There are 2 methods you can install this. 
1. with the install.sh: This automatically does install everything needed, builds the container and configures everything needed to get the server running
2. Building and setting everything up by yourself.

I will get into both methods. The install.sh method is prefered

# First clone this repo
## Install git:

Debian/Ubuntu:
```
apt install git
```
CentOS/Fedora:
CentOS doesnt seem to work for now.
```
yum install git
```
Arch:
```
pacman -S git
```
## Clone the Repo:
Clone the Repo, good folders are /opt or /srv as an example.

Clone it with:
```
git clone https://github.com/BL00DY-C0D3/Echo-VR-Server-on-Docker.git
```
**You need to have the Echo-Folder called  "ready-at-dawn-echo-arena" inside the folder you just cloned called "Echo-VR-Server-on-Docker"**

cd into **Echo-VR-Server-on-Docker** with
```
cd ./Echo-VR-Server-on-Docker
```

# Install using the install.sh script

As already mentioned this method does almost everything for you.
Just run the install.sh with 
```
bash ./install.sh
```
and it will ask you everything needed like IP, Port, Name, Region and more.

**You are done.**

To start a new container just run the run.sh script with 
```
bash ./run.sh
```
Every running Container will stay on as long as you dont stop them manually. Even after reboot!
See  at **Important Things** for more important informations.


# Install and configure it all by yourself

1. Install Docker
2. Install lsof (Not needed if you dont use the run.sh to start a container)
3. Build the container with:
  
   ``` 
   docker build -t ready-at-dawn-echo-arena . 
   ```
4. Configure the config.json at ./ready-at-dawn-echo-arena/_local/config.json
5. Configure the $region variable at ./scripts/start-echo.sh

# Start a container:

**1.** To start a container you can either just use the run.sh script by:

```
bash ./run.sh
```
This will check for an unsused port and automaticaly uses the lowest available port that is configured in your 
```
./ready-at-dawn-echo-arena/sourcedb/rad15/json/r14/config/netconfig_dedicatedserver.json
```
It also cleans up the log-folder by moving them into ./ready-at-dawn-echo-arena/logs/old

**2.**
Or you start it with the following command:
```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -v $(pwd)/ready-at-dawn-echo-arena:/ready-at-dawn-echo-arena -v ./scripts:/scripts  -p <inner_port>:<outer_port>/udp ready-at-dawn-echo-arena &
````

**It is important that you dont use the -host flag for remove of the network isolation between host and container, as this also changes the hostname of the container.
This will break it!**

**Every running Container will stay on as long as you dont stop them manually. Even after reboot!**

# Slowly stop or restart all server Instances, by waiting for running matches to be over:
Inside the scripts folder is a script called **slowlyCloseServers.sh**
If you start it with
```
bash ./slowlyCloseServers.sh
```
it will slowly close all server instances.
If you want to restart all server instances use
```
bash ./slowlyCloseServers.sh --restart
```


# Important Things:
- Logs are located in:
```
./ready-at-dawn-echo-arena/logs/<container_id>
```
- Show running containers:
```
docker ps
```
- Stop a running container:
```
docker stop <container_id>
```
- Stop all containers (Ignore the warnings):
```
docker stop $(docker ps)
```

- Change the start parameters of the Echo Server:
They are configured in the following file
```
./scripts/start-echo.sh
```

- If you want to allow the server instances to run on not more then X threads, you can use the following parameter.
Dont set this to low, as it will need enough threads to run. 2 should be the minimum.
```
-numtaskthreads X
```
